    <p>I let my soul fall into you
    I never thought I'd fall right through
    I fell for every word you said
    You made me feel I needed you
    And forced my heart to think it's true
    But I found I'm powerless with you
    Now I don't need your wings to fly
    No, I don't need a hand to hold in mine this time
    You held me down, but I broke free
    I found the love inside of me
    Now I don't need a hero to survive
    'Cause I already saved my life
    'Cause I already saved my life
    I fell into your fantasy
    But that's all our love will ever be
    I lost hope in saving you and me
    You think I'm lost, falling apart
    But your lies just made a stronger heart
    My life is just about to start
    Now I don't need your wings to fly
    No, I don't need a hand to hold in mine this time
    You held me down, but I broke free
    I found the love inside of me
    Now I don't need a hero to survive
    'Cause I already saved my life
    Already saved my life
    I already saved my life
    Already saved my life
    I already saved my life
    Now I don't need your wings to fly (don't need your wings to fly)
    No, I don't need a hand to hold in mine this time (this time)
    You held me down, but I broke free
    I found the love inside of me
    Now I don't need a hero to survive
    'Cause I already saved my life
    Already saved my life
    I already saved my life
    Already saved my life
    I already saved my life
    Now I don't need your wings to fly
